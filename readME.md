Recursive Reasoning - Making AI better

	Steps

    1. The AI will receive the user's prompt.

    2. The AI will need to reason with the users prompt, and example system prompt that can be given to the AI is: 

	        Do not generate a response for the user. You must think about the user's prompt, and understand it. Reason with yourself on the users prompt. For example: "Can a lion beat a human?", your thinking process can be like: "The user is asking me if a lion can beat a human. First I must find out if they are talking about a lion. They most likely are, let's also assume the human is   unarmed. Now can a lion actually beat a human? My reasoning is yes, a lion can beat a human."

    3. Once the AI reasons with itself, it will use the reasoning to then generate the final response to the user. An example system prompt of this is: 

	        The text provided, is a reasoned response generated by you. Now you must take this reasoned prompt, and generate a response based on it.
